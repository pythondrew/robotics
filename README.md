Python code for FIRST Robotics

* catapult.py 
    looking at optimal gearing for a direct-drive catapult. Simulation of voltage and current vs time.

* initcv.py
    code for a beaglebone black talking to a logitech webcam. python-opencv is missing a few things..
    might need to call some C code directly

* testcv.py 
    trying to synchronize turning an LED on and off using a multithreaded approach.
    varying the delay in the LED thread yields unexpected results sometimes.
